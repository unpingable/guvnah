# Provenance

This project is human-directed and AI-assisted. Final design authority,
acceptance criteria, and editorial control rest with the human author.
AI contributions were material and are categorized below by function.

## Human authorship

The author defined the project direction, requirements, and design intent.
AI systems contributed proposals, drafts, implementation, and critique under
author supervision; they did not independently determine project goals or
deployment decisions. The author reviewed, revised, or rejected AI-generated
output throughout development.

## AI-assisted collaboration

### Architectural design and view decomposition

Lead collaboration: ChatGPT (OpenAI). Heavy involvement in view design,
authority model ("untrusted cockpit"), panel isolation strategy, IPC layering
decisions, and the "what not to build" boundary (Guvnah observes, never acts).
Also contributed substantially to the Execution Integrity view design,
claims panel layout, and daemon shape probing strategy.

### Implementation, tests, and integration

Lead collaboration: Claude (Anthropic) via Claude Code. Heavy contributions to
source code, Svelte 5 components, store modules, RPC client wiring, IPC
handlers, preload bridge, test suites, shape adapters, and build configuration,
including assembly of architectural decisions into working code.

### Governor-in-the-loop development

The [Agent Governor](https://github.com/unpingable/agent_governor) daemon is
both the system Guvnah renders and a tool used during its own development:
evidence gate checks on generated code, pre-commit hooks, and receipt emission.
Included because it is unusual and directly relevant to the project's thesis.

## Provenance basis and limits

This document is a functional attribution record based on commit history,
co-author trailers (where present), project notes, and documented working
sessions. It is not a complete forensic account of all contributions.

Some AI contributions (especially design critique, rejected alternatives,
and footguns avoided) may not appear in repository artifacts or commit
metadata.

Model names/tools are recorded at the platform level (e.g., ChatGPT,
Claude Code); exact model versions may vary across sessions and are not
exhaustively reconstructed here.

## What this document does not claim

- No exact proportional attribution. Contributions are categorized by
  function, not quantified by token count or lines of code.
- Design and implementation were not cleanly sequential. Architecture
  informed code, code revealed design gaps, and the feedback loop was
  continuous.
- "Footguns avoided" and "ideas that didn't ship" are real contributions
  that leave no artifact. This document cannot fully account for them.
